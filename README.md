# Snake

Good old snake game we all remember from old phones :)
Approch is also based on Grid made of divs (as in Tetris), but logic and code developed independently from Ania Kubow's tutorial.

# Features
- snake can move up, down, left and right
- if snake moves to the right and user presses left arrow key - user loses game
- each time snake collects item, it starts to move faster by 25ms
- snake's body consists of items of random color

# Further development
- create several items on the field
- each time snake collects item with the same color as it's head - snake drops this item (body does not grow with it) and user gets points (as in Zumba game)
- create obstacles on the filed or other moving items..
